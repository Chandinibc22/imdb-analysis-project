# 🎬 IMDb Movie Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes IMDb movie data to understand movie trends, genre performance, audience ratings, and factors contributing to movie success. It demonstrates core skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving insights.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Converted columns to correct data types
- Removed invalid or duplicate entries

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Rating distribution and trends
- Genre-wise rating and popularity comparison
- Correlation between budget and rating
- Trends over release years

### 3. Visualization
- Bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and count plots used to represent patterns clearly.

## Key Insights
- Genres like **Drama** and **Thriller** tend to have consistently higher ratings.
- The number of movies released increased significantly after 2000.
- A higher movie budget does **not always** result in better ratings — quality matters.
- Some genres are popular but receive lower average ratings (volume vs. value).
